- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DracoArgenteus (He/Him)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in nanoscience, theoretical quantum chemistry, and applied statistics
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning various aspects of running and analysing TD-DFT quantum chemistry simulations. I'm playing around with different combinations of hybdrid functionals, but want to explore QM/MM options in the future.
